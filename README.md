# updates - 27 Jan 2019 
- added a "deep-optimal-stopping" folder, where two main notebooks are found;
- "AmericanOption" - presents an implementation for a deep learning solver for optimal stopping 
  problems; in this case it is presented in a toy example;
- "American-option-tf-estimator" presents the same problem, but in a tensorflow estimator implementation.
  This part is still work in progress...

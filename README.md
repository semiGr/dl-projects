- added a "deep-optimal-stopping" folder, where two main notebooks are found;
- "AmericanOption" - presents an implementation for a deep learning solver for optimal stopping 
  problems; in this case it is presented in a toy example;
- "American-option-tf-estimator" presents the same problem, but in a tensorflow estimator implementation.
  This part is still work in progress...
  
# updates - 6 May 2019
- added the python notebook of the dog classifier project as part of the Udacity projects. Note that
  it is only part of the project, as the data files required for the actual are too big to upload.
